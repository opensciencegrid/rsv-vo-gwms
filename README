Use Case
========
Rsv-vo-gwms is a package that is meant to do end-to-end regular testing of [GlideinWMS](https://glideinwms.fnal.gov/).
More specifically it is mean to submit a set of HTCondor Vanila universe jobs to the set of supported grid sites of a Virtual Organization (VO).
It can be thought of as a [SAM-light](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/CompOpsSAMTests) set of grid tests.

Requirements
============
1. The Virtual Organization has already a working [Glideinwms Frontend](https://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/frontend/index.html)
1. The Virtual Organization creates a set of probes(jobs or capabilities it wants to test out of a site).
1. A Rhel6/6 machine that can install rsv as root.
1. An Open port to the WAN
1. A Public IP

Architecture
============
The architechture of `rsv-vo-gwms` is based on the architechture of RSV. It is meant as a set of probes (jobs) 
that are periodically run using HTCondor-cron. 
Traditionally RSV installations would submit grid tests(HTCondor-C) from a host to the same host HTCondor-CE.
RSV-VO-GWMS submits a set of Vanilla Jobs that are meant to run at different locations in the Grid.

The basic idea is that a user (A VO Manager) just needs to edit one "master" probe's configuration (org.osg.local-gfactory-querying-local) select the VO it wants to test. Then the master probes will enable the actual "test probes" at each site the VO is allowed to run in. It does by querying a factory HTCondor collector and filtering the sites based on if they suppport a given organization, or the sites match a specific constraint (i.e Give me the name of sites that suport LIGO and VIRGO). From then on the submit host where RSV-VO-GWMS is just like any other submit host in a HTCondor-Pool.

Behind the scenes the master probes enables the same test jobs for each site it finds on the list obtained above.
Each job is a probe and while the default configuration ships a "dummy-vanilla-probe" this is meant as a template for each organization to write downs as many probes for what they want to test a site(i.e software installation, access to storage or network setup).


Brief Installation guide
========================
1. Install the rsv-vo-gwms RPM
1. Disable gratia in /etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini
1. Enable the gfactory vo query
rsv-control --enable org.osg.local-gfactory-querying-local --host myhost
1. Modify /etc/rsv/rsv.conf
And update proxy-file entry to your VO proxy.


Where myhost is the host where rsv-vo-gwms is installed
