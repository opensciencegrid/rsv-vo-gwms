#rsv-vo-gwms

> :warning: **This package is not longer supported neither packaged by OSG**

Architecure
===========
rsv-vo-gwms architecture is identical to the one of [rvs-gwms-tester](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/rsv-gwms-tester).
Except it submits Condor-C jobs instead of Condor Vanilla jobs. In this regard it acts as a [GlideinWMS Factory](https://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/index.html). This way it does not need a GlideinWMS Frontend to work as rsv-vo-gwms does.

Requirements
============

1. An X509 certificate with the VOMS extension of the Virtual Organization (VO).
1. A RedHat running machine where rsv-gwms-tester can be installed as root

Brief Installation
===================

1. Install the rsv-vo-gwms RPM. `yum install rsv-vo-gwms`
1. Disable gratia in /etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini
1. Enable the gfactory vo query
rsv-control --enable org.osg.local-gfactory-querying-local --host localhost
1. Modify /etc/rsv/rsv.conf
And update proxy-file entry to your VO proxy.
